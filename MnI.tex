A digital electronic kit was created with over 230 individual designs of logic gates and flip-flops of different kinds and strength for the AMF silicon photonics process\CitationNeeded.
The GDS design and their \textit{Library Exchange Format} were made by the python-based drawing tool for photonics, GDSFactory \CitationNeeded.
Tney were then fed into an open-source automated router, OpenROAD\CitationNeeded, along with the verilog design files and the translated technology files based on the foundry's process manual. 
The Linux-based tool running on a Windows-WSL machine then outputted a simple digital core made for with a serial-parrallel interface (SPI), shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Core}, with the capabilities to access up to eight 12-bits DAC and ADC.

Some challenges did arise, one file we were not able to provide to the router yet is the timing library of the gates, which can either be simulated by parasitic extraction simulations or constructed via a measurment campaign.  
Nevertheless, not having the exact timing of the gate influences the maximum clock frequency of the circuit, not its logics, as the circuit will still be capable to compute at a lower speed than expected. 
Additionnaly, during our first measurment campaign of the reduced $L$ and smaller gap transistors, a flaw in the fabrication process was discovered. 
Since the photonics nodes care much more about the optical properties of the waveguides, when we closed the gap between the channel and the gate,a significant amount of the transistor exhibited an unwanted electrical connection was made between the gate and the drain/source or channel, meaning that the device was unusable with the minimal distance prescribed by the foundry.
