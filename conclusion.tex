Advancements towards a fully electronics-photonics monolithic node were demonstrated by improving of the fundamental building block, the MOSFET, permitting the building of a digital electronics library. 
This library was then used with open-source tooling to produce a digital core with SPI capabilities showing that the implementation of a digital library was successful.
Next steps of this endavour are to build a simulation environment where the analog transistors are well modelled in order to construct the rest of the analog and mixed component to create a completely digitally adressable photonics structures.
